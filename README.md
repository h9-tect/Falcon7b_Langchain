# Falcon7b_Langchain
# Text Generation with Falcon-7b and Langchain

This repository contains code for setting up a text generation pipeline using the Transformers library from Hugging Face and the Langchain library. The pipeline allows you to generate text using pre-trained language models and customize the generation process based on your requirements.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to install the required libraries.
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your Python environment.

## Usage

1. Load the Falcon7b model:
   - The code loads the Falcon7b model from the Hugging Face Model Hub using the `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` identifier. It initializes the tokenizer and determines the device (CPU or GPU) for model computations.

2. Set up the text generation pipeline:
   - The code uses the Transformers library to set up a text generation pipeline with various parameters such as the model, tokenizer, data type, maximum length, sampling options, etc.

3. Import the HuggingFacePipeline class:
   - The code imports the `HuggingFacePipeline` class from the Langchain library, which allows you to create a local pipeline from a Hugging Face model.

4. Instantiate the HuggingFacePipeline object:
   - The code creates an instance of the `HuggingFacePipeline` class using the pipeline set up in step 2. This object can be used to interact with the local pipeline for text generation.

5. Generate text using the pipeline:
   - You can generate text by passing a question or instruction to the pipeline object. The generated text will be returned as the result.

6. Conversation handling:
   - The code provides an example of conversation handling using the Langchain library. It sets up a conversation chain with a conversation memory, allowing you to initiate and continue conversations with the text generation model.
